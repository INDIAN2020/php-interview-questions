    🟠 addslashes(): Escapes special characters in a string for use in SQL.
    ⚪ mysqli_real_escape_string(): Escapes special characters in a string for MySQL queries.

  2. Hashing and Encrypt Sensitive Data
    🔴 password_hash(): Creates a secure password hash using bcrypt or Argon2.
    🟢 password_verify(): Verifies that a password matches its hash.
    🟡 hash(): Generates a hash using various algorithms (e.g., SHA256).
    🟠 hash_hmac(): Generates a keyed hash value for message authentication.
    ⚪ openssl_encrypt(): Encrypts data using OpenSSL algorithms.
    🟣 openssl_decrypt(): Decrypts data encrypted by openssl_encrypt().

    🌐 random_int(): Generates cryptographically secure random integers.

  3. Session and Cookies
    🔴 session_start(): Starts a secure session.
    🟢 session_regenerate_id(): Regenerates a session ID to prevent session fixation.
    🟡 setcookie(): Sets secure cookies with options like HttpOnly and Secure.
    🟠 session_set_cookie_params(): Configures session cookies to enhance security.

  4. Error Handling
    🔴 error_reporting(): Configures which PHP errors are reported.
    🟢 ini_set(): Sets runtime configurations, such as disabling error display.

  5. Filesystem Security
    🔴 basename(): Strips directory paths to prevent directory traversal attacks.
    🟢 realpath(): Resolves the absolute path to ensure secure file access.
    🟡 chmod(): Changes file permissions to restrict access.

  6. Network Security
    🔴 openssl_pkey_new(): Generates a new private/public key pair.
    🟢 openssl_sign(): Creates a digital signature for data.
    🟡 openssl_verify(): Verifies a digital signature.

  7. Miscellaneous
    🔴 escapeShellArg(): Escapes a string to be safely used in a shell command.
    🟢 escapeShellCmd(): Escapes a command string to prevent command injection.
    🟡 is_uploaded_file(): Verifies if a file was uploaded via HTTP POST.
